**#OBJECTIVES :**


Evaluate the performance of AI models to determine their effectiveness in solving a particular problem.

Compare the performance of different AI models to identify the best model for a specific task.

Identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model to inform future model development and improvement.

**#key activities :**


Data Preparation: Prepare the dataset for evaluation, including data cleaning, preprocessing, and splitting into training and testing sets.

Model Implementation: Implement and train multiple AI models using different algorithms and techniques.

Evaluation Metric Selection: Select appropriate evaluation metrics for the specific problem and task, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean absolute error, mean squared error, etc.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using the selected evaluation metrics.

Model Comparison: Compare the performance of each model to identify the best model for the specific task.

Result Interpretation: Interpret the results of the evaluation and comparison to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

Model Selection: Select the best model for deployment based on the evaluation and comparison results.
